Trademark

Bacula®  is a registered trademark of Kern Sibbald. You may make fair use of the word Bacula in your websites and documentation providing you are referring to the Bacula community version and not an incompatible fork, which should have a different name. Generally, providing you do not make commercial use of the name Bacula, you may create websites in non-English languages to promote the use of the Bacula community code. However, your website should contain little or no commercial information, though links to commercial sites is permitted. The main concept is that Bacula is an open source (free software) product and any Bacula website should maintain that use of the name Bacula. Bacula Systems SA has been authorized by Kern Sibbald to use the name Bacula in their company name as well as with their Enterprise versions in return for them making major contributions to the Bacula community version.

 
Copyright Assignment Agreement

Developers who have contributed significant changes to the Bacula code must sign a Copyright Assignment Agreement (CAA — formerly called a Fiduciary License Agreement or FLA), which guarantees them the right to use the code they have developed, and also ensures that Kern (and thus the Bacula project) has the rights to the code.  By signing the CAA, your contributions are eligible to be integrated into the Bacula source code.  Having the CAA signed is essential for the Bacula project to maintain a clean copyright and guarantees that Bacula and your source code will always remain Free Software (Open Source).  Providing that your contribution is accepted by the Bacula project, your signed CAA also permits Kern to submit your contribution for  use in the Bacula Enterprise Edition.
